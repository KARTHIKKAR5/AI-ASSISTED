        "3.  **`hash_password(password)` function**: This function takes a password as input, encodes it, and then uses the SHA-256 algorithm from the `hashlib` library to create a secure hash of the password. It returns this hashed value.\n",
        "4.  **`register_user(username, password)` function**:\n",
        "    *   Takes a `username` and `password` as input.\n",
        "    *   Checks if the `username` already exists as a key in the `users_db` dictionary.\n",
        "    *   If the username exists, it returns an error message.\n",
        "    *   If the username doesn't exist, it hashes the password using the `hash_password` function and stores the username and the hashed password in the `users_db` dictionary.\n",

        "5.  **`login_user(username, password)` function**:\n",
        "    *   Takes a `username` and `password` as input.\n",
        "    *   Checks if the `username` exists as a key in the `users_db` dictionary.\n",
        "    *   If the username doesn't exist, it returns an error message.\n",
        "    *   If the username exists, it hashes the provided password using the `hash_password` function and compares this new hash with the hashed password stored in `users_db` for that username.\n",
        "    *   If the hashes match, it means the password is correct, and it returns a success message.\n",
        "    *   If the hashes don't match, it returns an incorrect password error message.\n",

        "    *   It runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.\n",
        "    *   Based on the user's choice (1 for Register, 2 for Login, 3 for Exit), it prompts for username and password and calls the appropriate function (`register_user` or `login_user`).\n",
        "    *   It then prints the message returned by the function.\n",
        "7.  **`if __name__ == \"__main__\": main()`**: This is a standard Python construct that ensures the `main()` function is called only when the script is executed directly (not when it's imported as a module into another script)."

        "# Explanation of the code generated for the highly specific prompt:\n",
        "# \"Write a Python function convert_temperature(value, unit) where unit is 'C' or 'F'.\n",
        "# If 'C', convert Celsius to Fahrenheit; if 'F', convert Fahrenheit to Celsius.\n",
        "# Validate input, handle floats, round to 2 decimal places, and include docstrings and example usage.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# What the code does:\n",
        "# This code defines a function called `convert_temperature` that is designed to convert a temperature value from either Celsius to Fahrenheit or Fahrenheit to Celsius. It's flexible because you tell it the original unit of the temperature you give it.\n",
        "\n",
        "# How it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. Taking Inputs:\n",
        "#    - The function takes two pieces of information: `value` (the temperature number itself) and `unit` (a letter, either 'C' for Celsius or 'F' for Fahrenheit, to tell the function which unit the `value` is currently in).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. Checking the Inputs (Validation):\n",
        "#    - The code first checks if the `value` you provided is actually a number (an integer or a float). If it's not a number (like text), it returns an error message.\n",
        "#    - It then checks if the `unit` you provided is either 'C' or 'F' (it doesn't matter if you use lowercase 'c' or 'f' because the code converts it to uppercase). If the unit is anything else, it returns an error message.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. Performing the Conversion:\n",
        "#    - If the inputs are valid, the code looks at the `unit`:\n",
        "#      - If the `unit` is 'C', it uses the formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit: (value * 9/5) + 32.\n",
        "#      - If the `unit` is 'F', it uses the formula to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius: (value - 32) * 5/9.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. Rounding the Result:\n",
        "#    - After calculating the converted temperature, the code rounds the result to two decimal places. This makes the output cleaner and easier to read.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. Returning the Result:\n",
        "#    - The function then gives back the rounded, converted temperature. If there was an input error, it returns the specific error message instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Understanding the Docstring:\n",
        "# - The text enclosed in triple quotes right after the function definition is called a docstring.\n",
        "# - It's like a built-in explanation for the function. It tells you:\n",
        "#   - What the function does (Converts temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit).\n",
        "#   - What arguments it expects (`value` and `unit`), what types they should be, and what they represent.\n",
        "#   - What the function returns (the converted temperature or an error message).\n",
        "# - Docstrings are helpful for anyone reading the code (including yourself later!) or using tools that can show documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example Usage Walkthrough:\n",
        "# The examples show how to use the `convert_temperature` function and what to expect:\n",
        "\n",
        "# - Example 1: Converting Celsius to Fahrenheit\n",
        "#   - `celsius_value` is set to 25.5.\n",
        "#   - `convert_temperature(25.5, 'C')` is called.\n",
        "#   - The function sees 'C', applies the Celsius to Fahrenheit formula: (25.5 * 9/5) + 32 = 45.9 + 32 = 77.9.\n",
        "#   - It rounds 77.9 to 2 decimal places (still 77.90, but prints as 77.9).\n",
        "#   - The output is: \"25.5°C is 77.9°F\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# - Example 2: Converting Fahrenheit to Celsius\n",
        "#   - `fahrenheit_value` is set to 77.9.\n",
        "#   - `convert_temperature(77.9, 'F')` is called.\n",
        "#   - The function sees 'F', applies the Fahrenheit to Celsius formula: (77.9 - 32) * 5/9 = 45.9 * 5/9 = 25.5.\n",
        "#   - It rounds 25.5 to 2 decimal places (still 25.50, but prints as 25.5).\n",
        "#   - The output is: \"77.9°F is 25.5°C\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# - Example 3: Invalid Unit\n",
        "#   - `convert_temperature(100, 'K')` is called.\n",
        "#   - The function sees 'K' which is not 'C' or 'F'.\n",
        "#   - It triggers the unit validation error.\n",
        "#   - The output is: \"Conversion with invalid unit: Error: Unit must be 'C' for Celsius or 'F' for Fahrenheit.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# - Example 4: Invalid Value Type\n",
        "#   - `convert_temperature(\"abc\", 'C')` is called.\n",
        "#   - The function sees \"abc\" which is not a number.\n",

        "#   - The output is: \"Conversion with invalid value: Error: Temperature value must be a number.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# In summary, this function is well-written because the highly specific prompt guided the AI to include essential features like input validation, handling different cases (C to F and F to C), formatting the output (rounding), and providing clear documentation (docstring) and examples."
