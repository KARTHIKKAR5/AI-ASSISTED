        "# 3. Text processing:\n",
        "#    - `text = text.lower()`: Converts the entire `text` string to lowercase. This ensures that words like \"This\" and \"this\" are treated as the same word for counting.\n",

        "#        - `r'\\b\\w+\\b'`: This is the regular expression pattern.\n",
        "#            - `\\b`: Matches a word boundary (the position between a word character and a non-word character, or the beginning/end of the string). This helps to match whole words and avoid partial matches.\n",
        "#            - `\\w+`: Matches one or more word characters (alphanumeric characters and underscore).\n",

        "\n",
        "# The modified `is_armstrong_number` function checks if a number is an Armstrong number using mathematical operations instead of converting the number to a string. This approach generally offers better performance, especially for large numbers, as it avoids the overhead associated with string conversions and manipulations.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Here's a breakdown of the changes and how they improve the code:\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. Handling Negative Numbers:\n",
        "#    - `if number < 0: return False`: An initial check is added to handle negative numbers. Armstrong numbers are typically defined for non-negative integers, so the function immediately returns `False` for any negative input.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. Determining the Number of Digits using Mathematical Operations:\n",
        "#    - `original_number = number`: Stores the original number in a separate variable to be used later for comparison.\n",
        "#    - `num_digits = 0`: Initializes a counter for the number of digits.\n",
        "#    - `temp = number`: Creates a temporary variable `temp` to work with, avoiding modification of the original `number`.\n",
        "#    - `while temp > 0:`: This loop continues as long as `temp` is greater than 0.\n",
        "#    - `num_digits += 1`: Increments the digit counter in each iteration.\n",
        "#    - `temp //= 10`: Performs integer division of `temp` by 10. This effectively removes the last digit of the number in each iteration. The loop continues until all digits have been \"removed\", and the `num_digits` variable will hold the total count of digits. This replaces the `len(str(number))` operation from the previous version.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. Calculating the Sum of Digits Raised to the Power of the Number of Digits using Mathematical Operations:\n",
        "#    - `armstrong_sum = 0`: Initializes the sum variable.\n",
        "#    - `temp = number`: Resets the `temp` variable back to the original number to extract digits again.\n",
        "#    - `while temp > 0:`: This loop iterates through the digits again.\n",
        "#    - `digit = temp % 10`: Uses the modulo operator (`%`) to get the last digit of the `temp` number.\n",
        "#    - `armstrong_sum += digit ** num_digits`: Raises the extracted `digit` to the power of `num_digits` and adds it to the `armstrong_sum`.\n",
        "#    - `temp //= 10`: Performs integer division to remove the last digit from `temp`, preparing for the next iteration. This replaces the iteration over the string characters and converting each back to an integer.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. Comparison and Return:\n",
        "#    - `return armstrong_sum == original_number`: Compares the calculated `armstrong_sum` with the stored `original_number` to determine if it's an Armstrong number.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Performance Improvement:\n",
        "# The primary performance improvement comes from avoiding the overhead of converting the number to a string and then back to integers for each digit. Mathematical operations (integer division and modulo) are generally faster and more efficient for digit manipulation, especially when dealing with large numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Structural Improvements:\n",
        "# The code's structure is slightly different due to the two separate loops: one to count the digits and another to calculate the sum. While the previous version used a single loop over the string, this mathematical approach requires these distinct steps. However, this separation can be considered a structural improvement in terms of clarity, as it explicitly separates the digit counting and the sum calculation processes."
